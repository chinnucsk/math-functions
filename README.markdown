Math-functions
==============

A port of Haskell [math-functions](https://github.com/bos/math-function)
(by Bryan O'Sullivan) in Erlang.

This library provides implementations of special mathematical functions and
Chebyshev polynomials. These functions are often useful in statistical and
numerical computing.

I hope this doesn't violate the initial software license. :-)
